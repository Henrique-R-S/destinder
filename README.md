# Destinder APP

## Relationships App (Tinder's parody)

### The idea of the application is to be an "Anti-Social" network that users who do not "like" each others are alerted about their locations to avoid possible encounters in real life.
### GeoFencing technology will be used to capture the location of individuals and alert if they enter a certain perimeter (with a distance defined by the user)
